# Valuation Metrics

Valuations metrics are used to turn vague “qualitative” descriptions of companies
(company is stable, earnings are good, dividends are profitable) into
quantitative ones. In other words, they allow us to speak in numbers rather
than adjectives.

As with all other things in this universe, it is worth knowing only 80% to rule
‘em all.
Here I list some valuation metrics that you will actually need.
